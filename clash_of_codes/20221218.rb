#The program:
#You are required to write a program that finds the number of vowels in each word of a sentence.
#
#- Words are separated by a single space.
#- The sentence may consist of letters, numbers and/or special characters. Specifically, it may contain any character in the range of characters having an ASCII value of 33 to 126 inclusive.
#INPUT:
#A single line of text consisting of at least one word.
#
#OUTPUT:
#On a single line, output the number of vowels in each word of the provided sentence. Numbers are separated by a single space.
#
#CONSTRAINTS:
#1 â‰¤ Length of the sentence < 1024
#
#List of vowels your program needs to consider:
#A
#E
#I
#O
#U
#a
#e
#i
#o
#u

        vowels.each{ |v|
            if v == c
                i = i+1
            end
